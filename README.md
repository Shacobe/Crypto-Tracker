# Crypto-Tracker
A python script to notify me when certain cryptocurrency prices go down, with additional features

This script uses the nomics API, to work correctly, you must sign up for a personal key from the nomics website to use in the url in place of "your-key-here".
I have not included my personal key in the url as it if for my use only.
